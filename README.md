# Macrophenology

Welcome to the **Macrophenology** repository, an integral part of the Environmental Data Science Innovation and Inclusion Lab (ESIIL). This repository is the central hub for our working group, encompassing our project overview, proposals, team member information, codebase, and more.

## Our Project
Given the sensitivity of plant phenology to environmental change, there is an urgent need to quantify plant phenological dynamics to better understand and predict this societally important biological phenomenon. For example, berry phenology is important to Indigenous peoples of Alaska, as are the timing of flowering and fruiting of many native species. Various types of data capture information on plant phenology (e.g., community science observations, observatory network data, remotely sensed observations, herbarium specimens); but rarely are these data types integrated. Without such integration, our knowledge of changes in phenology across time and space is limited. For instance, it is unknown how phenological change will affect species distributions and developmental events in ecosystems or if it will differentially favor nonnative species. Such understanding will help predict shifts in species distributions as well as aid in conservation. We will focus on the interaction between phenological shifts and species range shifts in response to climate change, using multiple sources of data and co-production with Indigenous peoples to further knowledge of how climatic change may alter plant phenology and range changes.
