This explains the two forms of analyses. 

The contents in the `SDM` folder are run first. They are numerically orderded. 

The contents in the `Regression` folder are run second. They are numerically ordered. 

The majority of the analyses were run using supercomputing (i.e., Cyverse) to run within a "reasonable" amount of time. 
Expect these to take a long time and computing power to run.
